### Graham - gamer with a low budget

I'm Graham and I really like playing games. Steam is my go-to, but recently I've had to dedicate more of my income to living expenses so I don't have as much money as before to spend on playing new games. I want a way to easily compare the prices for any given game across multiple providers so I can get the game at the lowest price. Knowing about upcoming sales would be great!

### Louise - Customer Satisfaction manager at W-Games

I'm Louise and I have the role at W-Games of ensuring customers are satisfied. W-Games is an upcoming games provider and a strategy that has been introduced to attract more customers is a price matching scheme. The idea is that at any given time, W-Games provides either a better price or better value for money than any other platform. To do this, I need to know about price trends in the market and sales occurring at any given time.

### Davide - gamer who has been previously scammed

I'm Davide and I really like playing games, especially when they're really cheap! In the past, I have used tools to find the platform that provides the games I want at the best price, however these platforms kept my data and as a result I lost a lot of money as my credit card details were stolen. I want to be able to use similar tools without data privacy issues, as I don't want to spend loads of time scouring the internet for good deals.
