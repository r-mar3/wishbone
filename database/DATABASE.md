## `table.sql` — RDS Table Schema

### What It Does
The `schema.sql` script connects when run creates 4 tables, game, listing, platform and tracking. For each table the primary key is autogenerated with appropriate key constraints elsewhere.

- Tracking stores user emails and the id of games they are tracking.
- Game stores the games we are tracking along with their RRP.
- Listing stores the price at a certain time from each website.
- Platform stores the platform names of the platforms we collect listings from.
